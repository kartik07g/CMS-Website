                                    <h3>What does Phonics mean?</h3>
                                    <p class="font-italic">Phonics is a branch of linguistics where the sounds and
                                        physical
                                        properties of human speech sounds are studied. Simply put, it is a system of
                                        relationships between letters and sounds in a language.
                                        Phonics is an effective tool and a multi-sensory method to teach young children
                                        to read
                                        and spell as they are taught to link an individual letter or letter combination
                                        with its
                                        appropriate sound and then blend the sounds to form words. The goal of phonics
                                        is to
                                        enable 'beginning readers' i.e. young pre-scholarsâ€™ to decode new written words
                                        by
                                        sounding them out so that they are able to read and spell well.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>All in all, phonics makes it much easier for the children to acquire, learn and
                                        master literacy skills of reading, writing and spelling. Not only these, we must
                                        understand that children who are able to communicate
                                        ably in English are bound to perform well in their academics because they can
                                        use English as a means to read more.</p>
